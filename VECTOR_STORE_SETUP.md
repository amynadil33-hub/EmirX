# Vector Store Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up vector stores for the OpenAI Assistants API to enable file search capabilities with specialized knowledge bases for each assistant.

## Required Environment Variables
The following environment variables need to be created in your Supabase project settings:

### Vector Store IDs
- `VECTOR_HR_ID` - Vector store for HR assistant knowledge base
- `VECTOR_SECRETARY_ID` - Vector store for Secretary assistant knowledge base  
- `VECTOR_ACCOUNTING_ID` - Vector store for Accounting assistant knowledge base
- `VECTOR_MARKETING_ID` - Vector store for Marketing assistant knowledge base
- `VECTOR_RESEARCH_ID` - Vector store for Research assistant knowledge base
- `VECTOR_LAWYER_ID` - Vector store for Lawyer assistant knowledge base

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Vector Stores via OpenAI API
Use the OpenAI API to create vector stores for each assistant:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/vector_stores \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v2" \
  -d '{
    "name": "HR Knowledge Base"
  }'
```

### 2. Upload Files to Vector Stores
Upload relevant documents for each assistant's domain:

```bash
# Upload files to a vector store
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/vector_stores/{vector_store_id}/file_batches \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v2" \
  -F "files=@hr-policies.pdf" \
  -F "files=@employee-handbook.pdf"
```

### 3. Add Environment Variables to Supabase
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ API
3. Scroll down to "Project API keys" 
4. Click "Add new secret"
5. Add each VECTOR_*_ID with the corresponding vector store ID from step 1

### 4. Update Assistants (Optional)
You can also attach vector stores directly to assistants:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants/{assistant_id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v2" \
  -d '{
    "tool_resources": {
      "file_search": {
        "vector_store_ids": ["{vector_store_id}"]
      }
    }
  }'
```
